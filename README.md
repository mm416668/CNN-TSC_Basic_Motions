# CNN-TSC_Basic_Motions
This is a test experiment for time series classification with BasicMotions dataset.  

In thes repository, we use sample data BasicMotions from University of East Angelia Time Series Datasets Archive. 

The basic idea of this test is we can treat each multi-variate time series dataset as a two-dimension table. And since the picture has same topology structure, 
I tried to use CNN on time series classification.

In this project, the preprocessing is to tramsfer sample data in each table and load to the environment.

Then trained the model with CNN
